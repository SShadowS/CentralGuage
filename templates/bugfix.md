Your previous submission failed to compile or pass tests.

## Error Details

{{error_snippet}}

## Instructions

1. Analyze the compilation errors or test failures
2. Provide a **unified diff** that fixes the problem
3. Do not resend unchanged files - only show the differences
4. Ensure the fix addresses the root cause
5. Test your solution mentally before submitting

## Format

Provide your fix as a unified diff using this format:

```diff
--- a/filename.al
+++ b/filename.al
@@ -line,count +line,count @@
 context line
-removed line
+added line
 context line
```

Focus on minimal, precise changes that solve the compilation or test issues.
