  Create a page extension named "CG Item List Extension" with ID 70053 that extends
  the "Item List" page (Page 31).

  Use the new BC 2025 Wave 1 feature to override the CardPageId property on a list page extension.
  Set CardPageId to point to the "Item Card" page (Page 30).

  The page extension should also add a new action in the Processing area named "Show Item Details"
  that runs the Item Card page for the current record.

  Include ApplicationArea = All on the action.
