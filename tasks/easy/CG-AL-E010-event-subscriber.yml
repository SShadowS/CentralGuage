  Create a simple AL codeunit called "Item Event Subscriber" with ID 70001 that subscribes to Item table events.
  Create an event subscriber procedure that:
  - Subscribes to the OnAfterInsert event of the Item table
  - Updates a custom log or displays a message when a new item is created
  - Includes proper EventSubscriber attributes

  The codeunit should have Access = Internal and include proper event subscriber syntax.
  Use appropriate procedure naming and ensure the event subscription follows Business Central patterns.
