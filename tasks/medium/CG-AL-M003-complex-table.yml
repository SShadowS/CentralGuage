description: >-
  Create a complex table called "Sales Contract" with ID 70002 that includes comprehensive validation.
  Fields should include:
  - Contract No. (Code[20], primary key, auto-generated)
  - Customer No. (Code[20], with TableRelation to Customer)
  - Start Date and End Date (Date fields with validation)
  - Contract Value (Decimal with minimum value validation)
  - Status (Option: Draft, Active, Suspended, Terminated)
  - Payment Terms (Code[10] with TableRelation)

  Include complex validation in triggers:
  - OnValidate for dates (End Date must be after Start Date)
  - OnValidate for Contract Value (must be positive, warn if over threshold)
  - OnInsert trigger to auto-generate Contract No.
  - OnDelete trigger to prevent deletion of Active contracts

  Include proper captions, data classification, and field validation patterns.
