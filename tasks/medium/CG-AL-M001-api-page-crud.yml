  Create a comprehensive API page called "Product API" with ID 70100 that provides full CRUD operations for a Product table.
  The API should:
  - Support GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE operations
  - Include proper error handling and validation
  - Have fields: id (SystemId), productCode, description, unitPrice, stockQuantity, categoryId
  - Include proper OData annotations and API versioning (v1.0)
  - Add business logic validation (price must be positive, stock must be non-negative)
  - Include proper captions, publisher info (mycompany), and API group (products)
  
  Use proper API page conventions with DelayedInsert, ODataKeyFields, and appropriate triggers.
  Include OnInsert/OnModify triggers for validation and audit logging.
