  Create a complex report called "Sales Performance Analysis" with ID 70001 that performs advanced data processing.
  
  The report should include multiple data items with complex relationships:

  Include advanced calculations:
  - Running totals by customer and region
  - Year-over-year comparison calculations
  - Average order value and frequency metrics
  - Top performing products analysis
  - Customer ranking by sales volume
  
  Implement complex dataset logic:
  - OnPreDataItem triggers for initialization
  - OnAfterGetRecord triggers for calculations
  - Group headers and footers with subtotals
  - Conditional formatting and grouping
  - Request page with date filters and options
  
  Include proper report layout structure, variables for calculations,
  and comprehensive data processing logic. Use ApplicationArea and UsageCategory.
