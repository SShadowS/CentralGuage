  - OnAfterGetRecord triggers for calculations
  - Group headers and footers with subtotals
  - Conditional formatting and grouping
  - Request page with date filters and options
  
  Include proper report layout structure, variables for calculations,
  and comprehensive data processing logic. Use ApplicationArea and UsageCategory.
