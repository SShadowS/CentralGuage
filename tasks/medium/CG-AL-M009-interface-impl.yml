  Create a comprehensive interface implementation for a shipping service.
  
  First, define an interface called "Shipping Provider" with ID 70001:
  - CalculateShippingCost(Weight: Decimal; Distance: Decimal; ServiceType: Enum): Decimal
  - EstimateDeliveryTime(SourceAddress: Text; DestinationAddress: Text): Integer
  - CreateShipment(ShipmentDetails: JsonObject): Text - returns tracking number
  - TrackShipment(TrackingNumber: Text): JsonObject - returns status info
  - ValidateAddress(Address: Text): Boolean
  
  Then create a concrete implementation codeunit called "Standard Shipping Provider" with ID 70004 that implements the interface:
  - Include realistic shipping calculations based on weight/distance
  - Implement delivery time estimation with business rules
  - Handle shipment creation with proper validation
  - Provide tracking functionality with status updates
  - Include comprehensive address validation logic
  
  Use proper interface syntax, implements keyword, and include error handling
  for all procedures. Add logging and audit trail functionality.
