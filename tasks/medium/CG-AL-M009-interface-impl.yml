  Create a comprehensive interface implementation for a shipping service.

  First, define an interface called "Shipping Provider" with ID 70001:
  - CalculateShippingCost(Weight: Decimal; FromCountry: Text; ToCountry: Text): Decimal
  - EstimateDeliveryTime(FromCountry: Text; ToCountry: Text; ServiceType: Text): Integer
  - CreateShipment(OrderNumber: Text; FromAddress: Text; ToAddress: Text; Weight: Decimal): Text[50] - returns tracking number
  - TrackShipment(TrackingNumber: Text): Text[100] - returns status info as text
  - ValidateAddress(Street: Text; City: Text; State: Text; ZipCode: Text; Country: Text): Boolean

  Then create a concrete implementation codeunit called "Standard Shipping Provider" with ID 70004 that implements the interface:
  - Include realistic shipping calculations based on weight and country routing (heavier packages cost more)
  - Implement delivery time estimation considering service type (Standard vs Express - Express should be faster)
  - Handle shipment creation with proper validation
  - Provide tracking functionality with status updates as text
  - Include comprehensive address validation logic for all address components

  Use proper interface syntax, implements keyword, and include error handling
  for all procedures. Add logging and audit trail functionality.
