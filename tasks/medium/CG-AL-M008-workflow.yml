  Create a workflow implementation codeunit called "Purchase Approval Workflow" with ID 70003.
  
  Implement a complete approval workflow system:
  - InitiateApprovalProcess(PurchaseHeaderNo: Code[20]): Boolean - start approval workflow
  - ProcessApprovalRequest(RequestId: Integer; Action: Enum): Boolean - handle approval actions
  - NotifyApprovers(PurchaseAmount: Decimal; RequesterUserId: Code[50]) - send notifications
  - EscalateApproval(RequestId: Integer) - escalate to higher authority
  - CompleteApprovalProcess(PurchaseHeaderNo: Code[20]; Approved: Boolean) - finalize workflow
  
  Include complex business logic:
  - Dynamic approver determination based on amount thresholds
  - Approval history tracking and audit trail
  - Timeout handling for pending approvals
  - Email notifications and reminders
  - Integration with user permissions and approval hierarchies
  
  Use event subscribers for Purchase Header events, proper error handling,
  and comprehensive logging. Include approval status management and state transitions.
